# Python GUI Projects

These python GUI projects are built in correspondence with " [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) " course. This course was taught by London's App Brewery top instructor Angela Yang.<br/>

Each project has been built from scratch with minimal to no assistance.<br/>

This project simulates the US states game. Read US states data from "50_states.csv" using the read_csv() function from the pandas library. Get the user guessed states as user input. If the guessed state exists then plot them on "blank_states_img.gif" using the x and y coordinates you previously fetched from the CSV file. Generate a CSV file with all the states that the user couldn't guess correctly when the user enters "exit" as input in the "What's another state name?" prompt.
